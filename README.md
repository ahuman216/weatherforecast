# weatherforecast
Find the weather of any place you want!

What your project is/does (and what it's called)
My project is called weatherforecast, and it asks you to enter your zipcode and gives you the current weather in your location in the units of your choice, as well as the daily high and low temperature. 

Why you made your project
I made this project because I am someone who checks the weather a lot, but often gets distracted by all the other things on my phone or Alexa, so this is a clean and easy way to check the weather. It is also kid-friendly and can help younger kids check the weather without seeing all the clutter on weather forecast pages.

How you made your project
I used APIs from OpenWeather such as their Geocoding API and their Current Weather API. Using the results from one call to pass into another helped me get minimal information from the user (only their zipcode), allowing me to print their requested information.

What you struggled with and what you learned
As I have not coded in python in a while, I struggled to get back into it and remember everything I learned. It was hard to put everything together, and especially hard to catch all possible exceptions using try and except.
